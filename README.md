# Durham People's Alliance - Donation Trend Analysis

## Project Background 

Durham People's Alliance (Durham PA) is a grassroots political organization that has been organizing to fight for a more progressive society at the city and state level for Durham, North Carolina. Durham PA is a member-based organization that hosts events, educates voters, and organizes members to take action on local issues, and it has relied almost solely on grassroots donations for financial support.

This project was conducted to help Durham PA better understand its donation history for the past 20 years, by drawing insights about patterns in donor behavior and  The insights are presented to the Board Members and Staff to help them make decisions about their future fundraising strategy and budget planning, and to recommend areas of improving their data infrastructure.

## Executive Summary 
Across the past 22 years, the Peopleâ€™s Alliance has earned total donation revenue of over $1.3M, with over 30K donations and over 4K people donating. On average, yearly revenue has been $56K, but in the recent 10 years this yearly average has become XXXX. Revenue had been increasing yearly until hitting an all-time highest value in 2018 of $126K. Since then, revenue has been declining.

A significant, persistent decline in revenue took place from 2019 through 2021, which is likely due to the COVID-19 lockdown and overall decline in member engagement. Notable peaks in donation revenue occur in 2012, 2016, 2018, and 2022, during which midterm and presidential elections were taking place. However, these peaks are always followed by a fall-off in donation revenue after the height of election season passes. 

The challenge and opportunity for Durham PA is to take advantage of the incredible spikes in donor engagement during these key years, and find new ways to sustain this engagement for the long-term. While this is no easy feat, doing so will help Durham PA not only retain election-year revenue, but also continue to strengthen their membership base.
