# Durham People's Alliance - Donation Trend Analysis

## Project Background 

Durham People's Alliance (Durham PA) is a grassroots political organization that has been organizing to fight for a more progressive society at the city and state level for Durham, North Carolina. Durham PA is a member-based organization that hosts events, educates voters, and organizes members to take action on local issues, and it has relied almost solely on grassroots donations for financial support.

This project was conducted to help Durham PA better understand its donation revenue history from 2004-2025*, by drawing insights about patterns in donor behavior and revenue drivers. The insights are presented to the Board Members and Staff to help them make decisions about their future fundraising strategy and budget planning, and to recommend areas of improving their data infrastructure.

*Note: There is only data for half of 2025, so 2025 is excluded from yearly analysis. 2025 is included where relevant to show performance of the new annual membership program.

## Executive Summary 
<img width="750" height="211" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-07 at 1 28 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3db72bfd-61d4-42d5-a5d7-13b0b6f22898" />

Across the past 20 years, the People’s Alliance has earned total donation revenue of over $1.3M, with over 30K donations and over 4K people donating. On average, yearly revenue has been $64K, but in the recent 10 years this yearly average has become $86K. Revenue had been increasing yearly until an all-time highest value of $126K in 2018, and since then revenue has been slightly declining. A significant, persistent decline in revenue took place from 2019 through 2021, which is likely due to the COVID-19 lockdown impacting member engagement. 

The main challenge and opportunity for Durham PA is to take advantage of the incredible spikes in donor engagement during key election years and find new ways to sustain this engagement for the long-term. Additionally, Durham PA can target outreach to existing but lapsing donors to turning around a recent decline in the past few years. 

## Insights Deep-Dive
### Revenue Drivers
**Donation Frequency Type** 

<img width="800" height="294" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64684380-0dd8-4644-ad38-8d6ff692a6ec" />

One-time donations take up the largest portion of revenue and are the clearest driver of revenue trends over the years. They contribute to spikes in revenue growth during election years, as well as to the declines in revenue post-election.
- The average size of one-time donations peaked in 2016 and 2022
- The number of donors giving one-time donations peaked in 2012 and 2018
  
Monthly donations take up a smaller portion of revenue, but serve a more stable and reliable revenue source. While monthly donations see less revenue loss after key election years, there is also less revenue growth during those election years. 
- Since it's onset in 2014, donation revenue and donor count for monthly donations had increased until 2017 but has generally plateaued since.

Annual donations only began in November of 2024, so data is limited. However, they are likely to become another reliable and stable source of revenue. There are already small spikes in revenue in January and June of 2025.

**Donor Type**

Revenue generated from new donors contributes more substantially to revenue spikes during key years. Still, over half of total revenue each year comes from returning donors.
- Revenue from new donors spiked in 2012, 2018, and 2022. Interestingly, revenue from returning donors spiked in 2016.
- Revenue from returning donors had steep declines in 2017 and 2020.


**Donor Demographic**

_Age Group Patterns:_ Revenue generated from the 30-44 age group has been growing the fastest, while revenue generated from the 65+ age group has been in decline. Under 30 age group has been consistently less than 1% of yearly revenue.
- The 30-44 age group began giving more in 2015, with a steep increase between 2016 and 2018
- In 2014, 65+ age group contributed 80% of all revenue, while 30-44 age group contributed just under 2%. In 2024, 65+ age group contributed 46% while 30-44 age group contributed 28%.

_Precinct Breakdown:_ Over 60% of all revenue has come from the following 10 precincts (out of 58 total precincts): 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 17, 20, 43


### Donor Base Retention Trends

<img width="607" height="194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd01561f-0a4c-47b8-b746-9149bcd31061" />

Yearly donor retention rates for Durham PA average at 55%. However, retention rates have been declining since 2023.
- Lowest retention rates were in 2013 and 2019, which is likely a result of losing many of the first-time donors who gave in 2012 and 2018. 

New donor count has been inconsistent each year, but there were enormous peaks in 2012 and 2018. The number of existing donors had been rising consistently until 2019, and since then has been on the decline.
- While new donors noticeably peaked in 2012 and 2018, about 25% of all historic donors donated for the last time in those two years.
- Many donors gave for the last time in the recent half decade: 36% of all historic donors had their last donation date occur in the years 2019 to 2023. This shows that the decline in donor activity is fairly recent, and those donors could be re-engaged.


### Giving Behavior Trends

<img width="704" height="281" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-07 at 1 15 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/725f43e2-9ed4-4318-b244-0819bd1536c7" />

Across all the years, there are some monthly seasonal trends in revenue showing that the highest revenue months are January and August, while the lowest revenue months are May and November. New donors tend to give more during the month of August, while existing donors give in both January and August.

There is noticeable month-to-month volatility in donation revenue, with many peaks and lows throughout each year. In the past five years, the highest performing month was August 2022 ($28,000) while the lowest performing month was October 2024 ($2,068). The average monthly revenue for these years was $5,845.

Election season doesn't seem to change the spending amounts of returning donors, but first-time donors tend to give more during some of these years. The average donation size of first-time donors tends to peak in key election years, with a tremendous spike in 2022. Meanwhile, the average donation size for returning donors does not change that much.


## Recommendations

**Optimize Revenue Sources and Stabilize Revenue** 
- Create a strategy to retain the spikes in revenue during election years. by maintaining engagement of new donors. During election years, focus on bring in
- Transition existing donors to start giving monthly or annually, and prioritize usage of monthly and annual options when soliciting new donors. Focusing on these recurring donation options will create relatively more stability in donation revenue. 
- Limit one-time donation options to instances like event admission or fundraising parties. 

**Re-engage and Increase Donor Base**
- Re-engage donors who have lapsed in the past 5 years. These donors have a high chance of giving again. It could be helpful to conduct a survey to hear why people stopped giving, to see if there are any trends.
- Target outreach to 30-44 year olds, since this is a growing segment. Consider also hosting multi-generational events as a way to re-engage older donors, and also to bring in younger donors

**Strategize on outreach practices** 
- Look further into outreach and event patterns to see if it is those factors, or something else, that directly impact monthly volatility in donation revenue. 
- Continue to conduct outreach to take advantage of high-giving patterns in January and August. Also consider running outreach campaigns during typically low-giving months (May and November) and years (years following big elections); this helps to stand out when other electoral noise might be low, and to help build relationships with urgency is low.
